# Turtle Challenge

My friend Pablo showed me this technical assestment and I thought it would be a great idea to resolve it to test my habilities as software developer.

The idea is to solve this in a language that I am not used to program (in this case C#) so everything is new to me, to see how can I apply my years of experience in python and web developing to a completely new area.

# The challenge

The idea of this challenge is to implement a simple board game with a turtle exploring a board. 

The turtle receives a set of instructions and a starting position and can move or rotate. If finds a mine, it dies and it wins if finds the exit.

The challenge is not the code itself, but to add a instructions and setup variables from files, in a professional way.
Also, the code has to be fail-resistant due to reading from text files what can contain anything.
